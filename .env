# S3 Bucket support
#
# Note: When using AWS S3 for storage, VITE_S3_BUCKET_URL should be empty (it's implied by
# the bucket name and region), for any other S3 compatible storage this should be defined
# as a full http(s) URI.
#
# S3 does not generate thumbnails on its own. BitMappery can lazily generate the thumbnails
# but keep in mind that this means download of the full resource, which can get costly when
# hosting on AWS (though once a thumbnail is generated, it is stored in the bucket omitting
# the need to download the full file again). For local providers (like MinIO) this should
# not be an issue. To generate thumbnails, set:
#
# VITE_S3_GENERATE_THUMBNAILS=true
#
# When using AWS:
#
# Create an IAM user with the common S3 actions (Get/Put/Delete) in its Policy
# Ensure Public Access for the bucket is not blocked
# Provide the following CORS configuration with the appropriate value for YOUR_URL
#
# [
